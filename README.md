# Laser Guided Space Interferometer (LGSI)
A concept for a CubeSat/SmallSat mission for a ~3 km baseline optical interferometer in space.

## Delta-v estimaetes (https://github.com/MIT-STARLab/LGSI/blob/main/Delta-v%20estimates.ipynb)
An example of orbits for the free-flying componenets of the LGSI: mirrors, combiner, and laser guide star (LGS).
The orbits are propagrated using poliasto with Sun as a perturbing body.
The exmple includes precomputed manuevers to keep mirros, aligned, increase uv coverage, and repoint the LGS.

## SNR requirements estimates (https://github.com/MIT-STARLab/LGSI/blob/main/SNR%20estimates.ipynb)
A very simple optical simualtion to very optimistically estimate the required number of photons from a target star.
